1. Layout agent & 2. Entity agent (architecture-related)
# Wireless-friendly IE design task: You are an expert in 2D floorplan design. Please help me plan four small rectangular rooms inside a 10m × 20m rectangular space with outer walls. The bottom-left corner of this space is (0,0). A personnel entrance (outer door) is located at (5,0). The four small rooms have fixed sizes: 4m × 10m, 5m × 6m, 3m × 6m, and 3m × 4m. The room can be flipped. Each room must have at least one wall overlapping with the outer walls. Each room must have a single wooden door (0.8m wide), placed on an interior wall (not on an outer wall). 
# Output: Your floorplan should optimize building wireless performance for wireless coverage while maintaining a functional and aesthetic architectural layout. Please think step by step and provide 10 potential solutions in the following format, listing the bottom-left, top-right, and door coordinates for each room: [[p1,q1,p2,q2,dp3,dq3], [p4,q4,p5,q5,dp6,dq6], ... ] without any other text. 

# IE Constraint:
1. Ensure the small room boundaries do not exceed the outer limits and no overlap between rooms.
2. Ensure the door is positioned on the wall of its small room but not on the outer walls.
3. Ensure each room has at least one wall overlapping with the outer wall.
4. Ensure the indoor space utilization is maximized while ensuring a clear circulation path. 
5. Ensure the outer door should not be blocked, and all rooms should be accessible from the outer door.

# BWP instruction knowledge: In AP deployment scenarios, building wireless performance can be improved by adjusting the layout, room positions, and door placement. Corner areas and wall obstructions should be minimized, as signal dead zones tend to occur at room junctions.
Rooms should be arranged within the AP coverage area as much as possible while minimizing mutual obstruction. The main corridors facilitate RF signal distribution and help minimize signal attenuation caused by passing through multiple walls. 


3. IWN design agent & 4. Correction agent (wireless-related)
# IWN task description: You are professional in the field of indoor wireless network planning and architecture. The following is information of a building layout {floor plan image}. Each pixel represents 0.1m*0.1m. Green areas represent doors and blue ones indicate windows, both of which may exhibit relatively low penetration loss. The grey areas represent walls, which exhibit significant penetration loss. 
# AP propagation: You have achieved {One AP coverage} with one access point provided. Coverage map results are: {One AP coverage map}. Locations with a path loss less than 80 dB are considered covered. 
# Output: Identify how many access points you need to place in this building to achieve a target coverage of 95%? Propose locations to place APs to meet a coverage of 95% in the format of [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], …, [xn,yn]]. 

# Instruction knowledge
1. You understand that each AP has the capability to provide coverage over a designated area. Its signal strength diminishes logarithmically with distance. 
2. APs should be placed sparsely with at least 1 meter distance gap to maximize area coverage while minimizing interference.
3. Adopt an exploration strategy that prioritizes uniform deployment followed by fine-tuning.
4. Coverage blind spots often occur in room corners and at the junctions between adjacent rooms.
# Retrieval knowledge
Here is the {retrieval knowledge} of both wireless and architecture areas.
# Perception: Simulation achieved {coverage} with and {AP locations} with a coverage map results {coverage map}. Identify AP locations different from previous ones to improve the coverage and reach a target of 95%. 
# IWN Correction: You act as a corrector, and please critically evaluate the deployment, identifying any issues such as: The APs are placed inside doors, windows, or walls; APs are placed outside the defined layout boundary. Provide your corrected solutions in format [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], …, [xn,yn]] after minimal refinements. 



5. Evaluation & update agent
# Evaluation: The best wireless-friendly IE design solution is {IE solution}. Here are its {coverage efficiency} and {coverage heatmap} after IWN planning. Considering circulation flow, space utilization, and aesthetics, the architectural rationality from the human architect is {human evaluation}.

# IE update: Referring to this result, please fine-tune the room positions and door placements to further enhance the building wireless performance and output updated solutions in the following format, listing the bottom-left, top-right, and door coordinates of each room: [[p1,q1,p2,q2,dp3,dq3], [p4,q4,p5,q5,dp6,dq6], ... ] without any other text.
